Excel Communications, a telecom Company got various departments. There are many resources in the department. Any employee may reserve for any resources by booking in advance with a clerk. Currently the clerk stores the resource booking information in a logbook. As the number of resources increases, the clerk has problem in answering whether a particular resource is available at a particular time. Furthermore, the employees have difficulty in keeping track of the resources that have allocated to them. In the event of resource damage, it is difficult to track who used the resource last. In order to solve the problem, the Department would like to provide a Resource Management System (RMS). The employees would use the system to book for the resources and keep track of the resource allocation themselves.
